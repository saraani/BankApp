                            Basic building block of angular
                          ...................................

                          1. Module - To import 3rd party -(root module - AppModule)

                          2. Componenet - to create html,css,ts files (Root Component - AppComponent)

                          3. Data Binding - share data inside component
                             
                             3.1  One way binding - data sharing only one direction.

                             3.1.1  component (ts) to view (html) 
                                 
                                 3.1.1.1 string interpolation - {{expretion}}

                                 3.1.1.2 property binding - [attribute name]="property name"

                            3.1.2 view(html) to component (ts)    

                                3.1.2.1 Event binding -  (event name)="function-name()" 

                                3.1.2.2 Event binding using $event -  (event name)="function-name($event)"
                                
                                            (if you need to bind event and everything with it )

                                            ( $event :- is a constent key . it have the capability to acess the details which associated by events.)

                                3.1.2.3 data sharing  using template referencing variable -  #variable_name

                                        (same use of $event , No need to bind events)
                                        (give 2 arguments inside of function call , its not neccessery to keep the variable name the same ,
                                        we can change variable name when we create the function at this point you should give variable type inside the function argument  )
